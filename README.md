Controls:
WASD to move and space to shoot discs. 
Pick up the discs in the red gears (the intake)

This was made mostly for skills route planning, since our field elements have not arrived yet.

The robot is a simple tank drive (4 motor) with an intake feeding into a single flywheel shooter. The robot intakes discs on one side and shoots them out the other. Speeds of all objects are approxiamated but not exact.
